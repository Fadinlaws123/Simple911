# üìÉ About Simple911

* *Well we all know how a 911 script should work, and as you know how they work, this one works the same, but gives 2 scripts together rather than one. This script brings you a 311 script as well as a 911 script together. Both having different coloring, commands, and functionality.*

# ‚ùì How to install

1. *How to install is simple, all you have to do is download the latest release of the script from https://github.com/Fadinlaws123/Simple911/releases.*
2. *Open the zipped file with either WinRar or 7.zip and extract the file to your desktop.*
3. *Drag and drop `Simple911` into your `\resources` directory and then type `ensure Simple911` in your console. After such the script should work perfectly!*

# ‚ùó Notice

* *Simple911 is a standalone resource with no dependencies, however, this script will not work 100% if you have 1. Another script in your server that does /311 or /911 or 2. Have installed [SimpleCore](https://github.come/Fadinlaws123/SimpleCore) as this script also comes with it's own 911 script built into it. However, aside from those the script should work.*
