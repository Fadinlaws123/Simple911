# 📃 About Simple911

- _Well we all know how a 911 script should work, and as you know how they work, this one works the same, but gives 2 scripts together rather than one. This script brings you a 311 script as well as a 911 script together. Both having different coloring, commands, and functionality._

# ❓ How to install

1. _How to install is simple, all you have to do is download the latest release of the script from https://github.com/Fadinlaws123/Simple911/releases._
2. _Open the zipped file with either WinRar or 7.zip and extract the file to your desktop._
3. _Drag and drop `Simple911` into your `\resources` directory and then type `ensure Simple911` in your console. After such the script should work perfectly!_

# ❗ Notice

- _Simple911 is a standalone resource with no dependencies, however, this script will not work 100% if you have 1. Another script in your server that does /311 or /911 or 2. Have installed [SimpleCore](https://github.com/Fadinlaws123/SimpleCore) as this script also comes with it's own 911 script built into it. However, aside from those the script should work._
